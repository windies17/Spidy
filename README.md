Scrapy is brilliant for getting information but how do we use it

Scrapy is a fantastic piece of software. BUT WITH GREAT POWER COMES GREAT RESPONSIBILTY

How to get started with Scrapy

STEP1

open your command line, for this we'll use terminal on the mac, make a directory

mkdir my_project_folder

STEP 2

if you dont have virtual env set up type in 

pip install virtualenv

STEP 3

to create a virtualvenv, type

cd my_project_folder
virtualenv venv

STEP 4

type in the following command to start your environment

source venv/bin/activate

you should then see

(venv)Your-Computer:your_project UserName$) 

SETTING UP SCRAPY

Now we have our virtualvenv set up we can type

pip install scrapy

scrapy will then be installed in your virtual environment
